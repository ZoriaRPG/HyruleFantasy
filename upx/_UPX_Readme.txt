These binary files are compressed with the UPX packer utility:

Some scanners may complain about them because of this, but 
	other scanners ignore them and complain about the 
	uncompressed files.

Until we find a solution, or can afford (and have the proper 
	legal (business) infrastructure to be able to certify 
	and digitally sign the programmes with a certificate
	issued by a recognised provider that will whitelist
	the ZQuest suite, this is the best that we can do to
	prevent binary files being deleted by false flags in
	scanning tools.
