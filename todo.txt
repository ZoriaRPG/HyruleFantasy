**List of Things to Implement in 2. Prior to Gamma 1**
    


    Emulation:
    2.10
        
    1.92 and 1.90
        

        1.92b50-ish; SOME SIDEWARPS MAY NOT WORK?
	
    
***GRAPHICAL***

1.90 Issues
	--fix (B33) did not work. We need to manually inspect tiles in older quests. -Z
    UP-FACING TILES HAVE ISSUES
    Hold-up item sprite tile is wrong. 
    
    1.90 anim tiles
    --I added some options to the Emulation menu in B32. let's see if they work. -Z	
	holdup (two hand): tile -=1 or tile = 31
	one hand tile also = 31?
	I need another **UNLOCKED** 1.90 quest to use as a reference to see 
		what tiles this should use. 

	attack/pound
	might need to copy walk tiles here, too
    
    Upward stab tile is wrong. 
    
    
    "Swimming in 1.90 uses the walking tiles instead of the swimming tiles for BS-Link even if you make them, so I just made the Flippers an item that lets you walk on water. However, if you play the quest in 1.92 it will look glitchy."
    --venrob Swim up
        It fucks up
        The other three directions seem right
        But up is fucky

    --P-tux And now it turns out using the hammer when facing up looks glitchy as well
        Cheat yourself a hammer in the modded BA2 in #tools-discussion and behold(edited)
        Seems diving has some issues too
        It uses a weird sequence of Link tiles. @NightmareJames did you say diving was invisible in 1.90?

1.90 quest icons may be corrrupt.



***DONE***


--done [b35--emulation] copy walking sprites to swimming sprites
--done, B34: In 1.90, Gel and Keese Tribbles used to turn into Gels and Vires, not the tribble counterparts.

--done (B32), covers 1.92 and 2.10, ONLY probably done  : Manhandla and lanmolas should alwas drop per segment.
		B31:: I also added Moldorm to this list.
		B31:: This needs verification and testing. 
		
--done B33 Triforce Piece in Item Cellar should warp Link in 2.10, or earlier.

--done B30: Fix controller/ley dialogues: Re-implement setting button for map.

--done B30: Verify triforce drop in ganon fight.

 2.10
        --added to Windrobe fix in B34. May be right, now. 
        --done B35: Wind Wizzrobes should use blue/bat wizzrobe movement, not linedup.
        --seems to be only a 2.50 bug? DMap intros always repeat.
        --done, except that I may need to reduce the version coverage. Half-tile trick is enabled. 
	
	
***NOT HAPPENING***
1.92 or 1.90
	--can't fix this right now, and nothing requires it, to my knowledge.
        Version unsure; it was either 1.90 or 1.92, but 
        For reference, you basically had to stand like a half tile away from a hookshottable combo, 
        and if you did it right you could merge partially with the tile. 
        And then once on that you could either get stuck or access places you're not meant to, depending on where it is
        Some quests have secret areas and such that could be accessed in this way
	
***NOT A BUG***
1.92b183 : Brang does not reflect if Link->invframes
		Did it EVER do this? --no, it did not.
