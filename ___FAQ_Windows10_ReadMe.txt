(Q) ZC gives me errors opening quests.
(Q) ZQuest cannot save my quest file. 
(Q) ZC/ZQuest are not saving my joystick/sound settings. 

(A) When running Zelda Classic (or ZQuest) on WIndows 10, you must
run them as Administrator ***and** the folders in which they 
reside must NOT be read-Only.

Failing to ensure that the paths are not read-only, or that
ZC does not have the ability to write (Administrator) will result
in ZC being unable to properly load quests, and will result in
the inability to save quests, config settings, and write the 
game save file.
